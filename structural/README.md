# Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern used to create an interface between two interfaces that are incompatible with each other. The purpose of using this pattern is to transform the interface of one class into another in a way that makes these two interfaces compatible, without modifying the original code of these classes.
