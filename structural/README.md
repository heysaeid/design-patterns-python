# Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern used to create an interface between two interfaces that are incompatible with each other. The purpose of using this pattern is to transform the interface of one class into another in a way that makes these two interfaces compatible, without modifying the original code of these classes.



# Bridge Pattern
The Bridge design pattern is correct. Indeed, the Bridge pattern is a structural pattern composed of two sets of classes (one in the Abstraction section and the other in the Implementor section), utilizing an interface (Abstraction) as an intermediary to connect these two sets. This pattern provides the ability to separate large classes and escape the complexity of inheritance.
