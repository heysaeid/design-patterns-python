# Singleton pattern
A Singleton pattern in python is a design pattern that allows you to create just one instance of a class, throughout the lifetime of a program. Using a singleton pattern has many benefits. A few of them are:
- To limit concurrent access to a shared resource.
- To create a global point of access for a resource.
- To create just one instance of a class, throughout the lifetime of a program.

# Python Meta Class
A metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is itself an instance of a metaclass. A class in Python defines how the instance of the class will behave. In order to understand metaclasses well, one needs to have prior experience working with Python classes.
