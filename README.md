#Design Patterns
In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

# Types of design patterns
1. Creational: These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

2. Structural: These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

3. Behavioral: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.




| Creational                        | Description                   |
| -------------                     |:-------------:                |
| Singleton                         | A Singleton pattern in python is a design pattern that allows you to create just one instance of a class, throughout the lifetime of a program                 |
| Factory Method                    | The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
